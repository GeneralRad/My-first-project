<h1>Finally Eneojo Isaiah Sunday is a developer.</h1>
<h2>Congratulations to me.</h2>
<h3>My favorite quote is YOLO "You only live once".</h3>
<h4>I hope and believe that before the end of this program this year,I should be able to face and conquer bugs in my programs alone.</h4>
<h5>I want to be a kind of programmer that gains joy in solving problems through code and also sees joy in sharing my knowledge to young birds</h5>
